# Simple ASP.NET #
## for Cornelius Concepts ##

This is nothing more than what comes with the basic project template in Visual Studio 2017's new ASP.NET Core Web Application project template with a few things changed to make it mine.  The only reason I'm publishing this here is for completion of the process that is all built into VS, from project completion, to testing, to publishing, to storing in an online repository.  Pretty slick!

You can build this yourself using [Microsoft's tutorial](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/) on setting up a new Web App in Azure in 5 minutes (*it's really that quick!*).
